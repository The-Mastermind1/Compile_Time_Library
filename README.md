# Compile Time Library üöÄ‚è≥ 
# üî∑ C++ Templates & Metaprogramming üèóÔ∏èüì¶

# EXPLANATION:
# BEGIN

1)This library 936 line of code it is well detailed of what it does<br><br>
2) the Macros.h header serves as a helper library to write exception and macros for the header.h 
and concepts that will be used at header.h<br><br>
3)The header.h simply contains simple utility functions that can be used at compile time <br><br>
4) inside this library there are various of functions structs and classes that use templates pretty much to give result at compile time<br><br>
5)some of them use template recursive instantiation to give the result like:
Is_Prime,Sqrt,Factorial,Fibonnaci,Max,Min,Terms

6)some of them are simple funcs that use recursion to give the result like :<br>
Str_Len,Parce_Integer,Binary_To_Decimal,Sqrt_For_Doubles,GCD,Popcount

# DETAILED EXPLANATION:
# BEGIN
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) There is a struct Supports_Sizeof which simply checks if you can apply sizeof operator into the passed type ,this uses SFINAE CONTEXT <br>
<br>2) there is also a better version of void that solves most of the problems that std::void_t has <br>
<br><br> 3)there is also a struct called dimensions which is pretty much the same with the std::rank from C++ Standard , i
thought about it alone 
<br>
<br>
4) there is also a struct called Largest_Type which takes a list of types and gives the type that is the largest in bytes 
<br><br>
5)there are two funcs that check if a string is palidrome you can use whoever you want 
<br><br>
6)there is also a wrapped struct called Identity that is used inside void t and largest_type
<br><br>
7)the struct has_size simply checks if the type passed supports a method called size();
<br><br>
8)there is also a struct called Type_Index that takes a list of types and then returns the index of the desired type9) The C++ Standard contains in the header <type_traits> a struct called std::conditional_t which takes a bool condition a first type and a second type 
and based on the condition it returns the first or the second type
<br><br>
i also created something like this but with values and is called  If_Then_Else which based on a bool  condition and two values that you gave it return one of them
<br><br>
10)there is also a func called Factorial which returns the result but it used for loop not template recursive instantiation 
<br><br>
11)the func Make_Reversed_String return the string that is given reversed 
<br><br>
12)the func Type_Name gives back the name of the type you gave it along with something else 
<br><br>
13)inside the Array_Algorithms class there are simple compile time algorithms for the array and one at runtime like :<br><br>
Binary_Search,Is_Sorted,Is_NxN ,dotproduct,doaddition,dosubtraction, print1D_array,Linear_Search,Bubble_Sort,Reverse_Array
<br><br>
15)There is also a func called Is_Equal_Strings
<br><br>
Also GCD=GREATEST COMMOND DIVISOR
<br>
Popcount counts the number of ones that the binary represntation of n has 
<br>
I Wanted a min max that could work with more arguments 
<br> 
there is also a struct called Abs and a func Is_Equal

Power of Integers gives the result x^n 

<br> the func called terms can be used to give the result of e^x and uses an approximation to do that, not the best func ....
you are the one that gives the iterations be careful with that ,the more iterations the better
